# Automatic-update-for-minecraft-bedrock-server-on-Ubuntu-Server
 This script was created in order to update minecraft from a linux server without losing the original configuration and the worlds created in previous versions.
* * *
To use, copy and paste into a file on your Linux system. Once saved, set the file to executable (chmod +x) then run.

Remember to stop any running server before running this script, then start your server once this script has finished.

This script was created with the purpose of being automatic, but due to changes in the mojang page, the download link of the .zip file cannot be obtained, so it must be obtained manually and pasted into the script in the 'URL' variable.
